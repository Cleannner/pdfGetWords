well in certain situations, but can hinder us in othersespecially when we needto consider metrics anddata,
rather than letting our instinct override everything. For example, if you want to stop checking your email
firstthinginthemorning,youmightdecidetosubstituteanotheractivityinitsplace.Butifyouwanttostop

I. The fourth one to avoid is not forgiving ourselves for slipping up. Of course, even the best-laid plans fail
sometimes.Youmighthavestuckto your screen-freenighttimeroutineforfivedays,andthena big project
landed on your desk and you found yourself in bed with your laptop before you went to sleep. Or you

exhaustedandoptedtoordergreasytakeout.Lifehappensandevenifyourbehaviorchangeissmall,every
single day can prove pretty inflexible, and at some point your luck may run out, even if just for a day. The
perfectionist in you might be screaming to abandon your goals altogether, but try to see it in the bigger
picture. Just because you might have temporarily strayed off course doesn’t mean youcan’t start afresh the
nextday.

celebratethesmallprogresstheymakeintheprocess.Yourbrainrespondstorewards.Thebasalganglia,the
brain region linked to our performance of habits, is most active at the beginning of a behavior, when the
habit is cued,and at the end, when it’s rewarded. Say your goal is to run five miles three times a week,and
this week you ran one mile on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Rather than focusing on how far you’ve
gone toward your goal, think about how you can reward yourself for the progress you’ve made. It doesn’t

K. Initiatinganewbehaviorusuallyseemslikethehardestpartoftheprocessofchange.However,peopleoften
failtoadequatelyprepareformaintainingit.Oneofthereasonsforthisisbecausewemistakenlybelievethe
strategiesweusedtoinitiatethechangewillbeequallyeffectiveinhelpinguscontinuethechange.Butthey
won’t. Where changing a strongly deep-rooted habit requires changing our belief about that habit that
penetrates deeply into our lives, continually manifesting that wisdom requires that we maintain a positive
outlook. If our mood is low, the wisdom to behave differently seems to disappear and we go back to eating
more and exercising less. The key, then, to maintaining new behaviors is to be happy! Which is why it’sso
hardtomaintainnewbehaviors.
L. Remember,overcomingthebehavioralinertia thatpreventsusfrom implementingnewchanges,likeeating
a healthy diet or exercising, can benefit us in the long run and can improve our physical and mental health.
No one was born with habits. They were all learned, and can all, therefore, be unlearned. The question is:
howbadlydoyoureallywanttochange?

37. One need not abandon their goals completely just because they missed their target temporarily; they can
startanew.

39. It is wrong to assume the strategies we use to start a change of behavior will work equally well in helping
maintainit.

40. Sometimes, it may not be successful to simply substitute one activity with another to effect a change of
habit;youmayneedextrareinforcement.
41. Oneshouldintroducesomethingnewtoreplaceanoldhabitinsteadofsimplykickingit.
42. Perfectionists focus too much on their big target and neglect celebrating the small gains they make in the
process.
43. It is of great benefit to us in the long term to conquer the inertia that stops us from making behavioral
changes.
44. The strategy that successfully changed one of your behaviors may not work for some other behavior of
yours.

may recognise that we feel andact differentlyin these rolesandrelationshipsthan we doat work. The passive
daughter becomes an assertive leader at work. Furthermore, our identities at work are not static. They change
overtime.Imyselfhavebeenashopassistant,a waitress,astudent,agraduate,anda clinicalpsychologist.At
each stage my ability to adapt to and develop my career identity has been crucial to my wellbeing. Whilst we
like to eliminate uncertainty in our lives at some level we have to manage uncertainty, especially in today’s
volatileandever-shiftingjobmarket.
How we see ourselves is central to the issue of our identity. When we tell ourselves “I’m good at starting
projects but not so great at seeing them through” it can become part of our belief system. But if you have the
unfortunate experience ofan enforcedjob change you will needto examine those beliefs to see how grounded
in reality they are. You will be required to ask yourself how helpful these beliefs are and consider personal
change.Wecanchangeourbeliefs,behavioursandemotionalexperienceatanytimethroughexperimentation,
